# Balanced Parentheses Check
#
# Problem Statement
# Given a string of opening and closing parentheses, check whether it’s balanced. We have 3 types of parentheses: round brackets: (), square brackets: [], and curly brackets: {}. Assume that the string doesn’t contain any other character than these, no spaces words or numbers. As a reminder, balanced parentheses require every opening parenthesis to be closed in the reverse order opened. For example ‘([])’ is balanced but ‘([)]’ is not.
#
# You can assume the input string has no spaces.

    if (len(s)%2 != 0):
        return False

    stack = []
    opening = set("{[(")
    pairs = set([("{","}"), ("[","]"), ("(",")")])

    for paren in s:

        if paren in opening:
            stack.append(paren)

        else:

            last_open = stack.pop()

            if (last_open, paren) not in pairs:
                return False
